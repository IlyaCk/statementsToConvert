If yes, you might not know this kind of entertainment. But it wouldn’t prevent you to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nIn older games, which have 2D graphics, one can run into the next situation. The hero jumps along the platforms or islands that hang in the air. He must move himself from one side of the screen to the other. The hero can jump from any platform number~$i$ to any platform number~$k$, spending $(i-k)^2\\cdot(y_i-y_k)^2$ energy, where $y_i$ and $y_k$ are the heights where these platforms hang. Obviously energy should be spent frugally.\r\n\r\nYou are given the heights of the platforms in order from the left side to the right.
