\begin{problem}{Decomposition into a sum of cubes}{stdin}{stdout}{1 second}{64 megabytes}

Given a positive integer $N$, you should decompose it to the minimum quantity of positive perfect cubes. The program should print this minimum quantity.

\InputFile
A single positive integer $N$ ($1\leq N\leq 10^6$).

\OutputFile
Program should print one positive integer ---  the minimum quantity of cubes.

\Examples

\begin{example}
\exmp{33
}{5}%
\end{example}

\Note
$33=2^3+2^3+2^3+2^3+1^3$, and 33 cannot be decomposed into a sum of less than five positive cubes.

\end{problem}
